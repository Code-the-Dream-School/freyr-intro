    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Roman Taye</h2>
    <p>
      In my career journey, I started as a cabin crew member for Africa
      Airlines, where I developed exceptional customer service and communication
      skills while ensuring passenger safety and comfort. Later, I transitioned
      to working as a restaurant server, where I further refined my customer
      service abilities and excelled in high-pressure situations. Concurrently,
      for a period of two years, I pursued my passion for electrical engineering
      through college, building a solid foundation in the field. During this
      time, I discovered my interest in programming and decided to enhance my
      skills by attending a coding boot camp, where I learned languages like
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and eventually React.js
