    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>I have been pursuing my passion in tech for some time now, through education, as well as through some relevant employment experience. What I have learned in tech includes an introduction to very basic server-side programming with PHP, working with a MySQL database and SQL; an introduction to very basic C#; an introduction to very basic Python; intermediate ActionScript; and basic JavaScript, though academic experience gained by completing college coursework. I also gained a very basic introduction to Java programming; and further basic skills in Python programming, through online courses from Lynda.com, LinkedIn Learning and Codecademy. Additionally, I have some professional experience working with ActionScript, HTML/CSS and very basic cut-and-paste JavaScript; have taken an HTML/CSS review course at “Code Tenderloin,” called “Pre-Code Ramp; and another introductory course on JavaScript though the same organization, called "Code Ramp;" although the current tech market now requires more programming skills than just what I have got.</p>
