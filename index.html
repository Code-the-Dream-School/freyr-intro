      <h2> -> EXPERIENCE:</h2>

      <p>
        I have been in the IT industry for 5 years and I started off as a manual
        tester and eventually expanded my skills to automation testing. So on my
        current project I am working mostly as a QA automation engineer on my
        team. For our Project - we are using various testing types, like
        functional, end to end an API testing. We developed Cypress/Js
        automation framework to write automation test scripts for our company's
        main Product .
