      <h2>Roman Taye</h2>
      <p>
        In my career journey, I started as a cabin crew member for Africa
        Airlines, where I developed exceptional customer service and
        communication skills while ensuring passenger safety and comfort. Later,
        I transitioned to working as a restaurant server, where I further
        refined my customer service abilities and excelled in high-pressure
        situations. Concurrently, for a period of two years, I pursued my
        passion for electrical engineering through college, building a solid
        foundation in the field. During this time, I discovered my interest in
        programming and decided to enhance my skills by attending a coding boot
        camp, where I learned languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        eventually React.js
