About
I’m Kirtan Desai I’m currently a sophomore at UTSA, majoring in cybersecurity. My experience consists of working as an intern at Code2College Labs as a programmer of multiple languages. The skills and knowledge I taken away from these experiences allows me to be a worker that endeavors to help increase productivity.  I’m hardworking, driven, and a quick thinker about the problem in front of me in a work environment.
