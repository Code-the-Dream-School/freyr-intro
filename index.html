About
Hey y'all, my name is Yeni Martinez and I am currently working as a Spanish 
teacher in New York City. I am hoping in 3 years or less to switch careers. 
I have been interested in software engineering for some time but I just 
couldn't find time to study since I have a very busy schedule. I am grafeful 
to have found a great program like Code the Dream because it has allowed me 
to work and study at the same time.
