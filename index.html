        <h2> About </h2>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Kateryna Mikhailiuk and I'm a Web Developer from Ontario, Canada.
        I have 10+ years of experience in travel and aviation industries.
        I decided to change my career direction and currently expanding expertise to the IT field. 
        About a year ago I found myself in Web Development and Coding became my passion. 
        I love to create beautifully designed, intuitive, functional websites and build multi-purpose apps. 
        Passionate about what is possible to achieve using the latest technologies and eager to learn new things!
        Interested in entire Front-End spectrum working on new projects with smart, creative, positive people!</p>
