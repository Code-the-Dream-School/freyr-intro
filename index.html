About 
A little bit on my background, I graduated from GSU with a degree in Computer Informations Systems. After a completing a couple of internships I realized that I was not interested in the work I had completed and transitioned into Recruiting because I enjoyed talking and helping individuals out, especially when came to helping them find work. I have developed many soft skills thanks to recruiting and it has helped me become a better listener and has help me ask better questions when it came to getting the information that I needed. After doing for three years, I decided to change my career trajectory and started relearning Python. I stumbled into Data Analytics and became very passionate about the work and field.
Even though I enjoyed Data Analytics, I decided I would rather be a software Developer and I am now taking a course with Code The Dream.
 Experience
 I have been recruiting and doing HR for 3 years at this point, I programmed in Java and Python in the past since I took a programming course in college.
