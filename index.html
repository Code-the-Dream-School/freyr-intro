Jason Fox
<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Jason Fox, I'm 45 years old and new to coding.
    I am very anxious becuase the technology for computers and apps has changes so
    drastically that I only hope I can get a grasp on it to be successful.
    I am also a VERY introverted person with self esteem issues so asking for help and talking to others
    is a VERY difficult thing for me to do.
    Once another person talks to me then I become a little bit extroverted and less "in my head" about things I'm
    thinkging about and saying to others.
</p>
