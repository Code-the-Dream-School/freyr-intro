        <li>About</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am a someone who would really like an opportunity to improve my JavaScript programming skills in order to learn enough about coding so that I can qualify for employment as an apprentice or intern, in a position that utilizes this type of knowledge and educational experience. This way, I can get back into the technical field, after being automated out a job by point-and-click, drag-and-drop web design applications, which made the work of former web designers; such as myself; obsolete! I am referring to applications like Wix.com and iPages, that make it so anybody with minimum knowledge of computer usage, is able to create beautiful websites without the need to hire someone else to do that sort of work.</p>
