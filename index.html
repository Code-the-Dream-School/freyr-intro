      <h2>*** ABOUT ME ***</h2>
      
      <p>I enjoy testing Software and have a passion to
        learn the new tools and technologies. Testing is a kind of solving a logical puzzle. We not only find the bugs. We break the system too in terms of stress testing. I do help in releasing a quality product to the market. Even though developers do their best to release a good product, there will be some mistakes. I also love to take challenges. Itâ€™s a big challenge to explore new systems and find the bugs. I am also enjoying coding.</p>

        <li>detail oriented</li>
        <li>cross-functional team member</li>
        <li>quick learner</li>
        <li>adaptable

      <h2>*** EXPERIENCE ***</h2>

      <p>
        I have been in the IT industry for 5 years and I started off as a manual
        tester and eventually expanded my skills to the automation testing. So on my
        current project I am working mostly as a QA automation engineer on my
        team. For our Project - we are using various testing types, like
        functional, end to end an API testing. I developed Cypress/Js
        automation framework to write the automation test scripts for our company's
        main Product.
