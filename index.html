About

My name is Aysa and I am a data and linguistics nerd. I love collecting data, analysing it and playing with it. I love learning new languages, forgetting them and re discovering them again. I speak Spanish, English, Russian, Kalmyk and Korean. Currently branching out to software developing as a student of the "Code the dream" school. I am very excited to learn more about the world of computers' thought process. My dream is develop a charity app connecting people who want to give with people who need help.
