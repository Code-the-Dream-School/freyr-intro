About:
I am 29 years old. I am an only child. 
I was born in Haiti and moved to the US when I was 5 years old. 
I like to sing, I am obssessed with kdramas, I am a good cook, but I don't like cooking often. 
I want to travel more as I get older. 
I love learning new things, I am currently trying to learn two languages.
